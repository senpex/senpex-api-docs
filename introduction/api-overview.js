<p>Welcome to the Senpex API documentation. You can use the Senpex API to provide same-day delivery to your customers.</p>
<p>Through the Senpex API, your application will be able to create and manage orders as well as retrieve the details and status updates on those select orders. The Senpex API is organized around REST and has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.</p>
