<p>The API requires credit card details which must be entered at API Dashboard. Notice, it is by default that Senpex will immediately provide the end user a price that will be expected to be paid for, however, the pricing is not determined by Senpex, rather the vendor is given the freedom to choose their own pricing structure.
