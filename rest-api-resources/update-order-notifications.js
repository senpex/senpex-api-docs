<p>From the moment of order creation and until the delivery is done, clients receive the real-time notifications about the delivery status of their orders. Currently our system supports four options for sending notifications:</p>
<p>
<code>Email</code> - messages delivered to the client’s email box;<br>
<code>Push</code> - a quick pop-up messages received from the client’s app;<br>
<code>Sms</code> - text messages delivered to the client’s cell phone;<br>
<code>Delivery Tracking Status</code> - delivery tracking notifications that can be accessed from the user’s personal account dashboard.
</p>
<p>By default each user receives email and push notifications, but our API allows you to modify notification preferences.</p>
